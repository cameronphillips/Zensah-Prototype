The Weather Shield example relies on the HTU21D and MPL3115A2 libraries. Download the libraries from the link in the Weather Shield Hookup Guide on Sparkfun.com [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/weather-shield-hookup-guide), and then install them into your Documents/Arduino folder. Import the libraries into your Arduino sketch before compiling.
