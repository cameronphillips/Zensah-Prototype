USB BT + Raspberry example setup instruction:

0) Install raspbian wheezy on you raspberry, just follow instructions on raspbian official site.
1) Please follow instructions from BluetoothSetup.pdf(same folder as readme)
2) During executing instruction you will obtain other side Bluetooth module's MAC(sensor MAC, cellphone MAC)
	Open the script and set BT_DEV_ADDR equal to obtained MAC.
	Also you can set some meta information about your organization and etc
3) Do the wiring. Construct/power up your bluetooth device on the other side.
	We tested on Arduino + HC-06 UART module on other side and ACORP USB BT module + Raspberry.

Notes:

1) This method should work with USB Bluetooth modules from here http://elinux.org/RPi_USB_Bluetooth_adapters.
	This list is not complete, code was tested on ACORP BT module, but if you use device from the list,
	you most probably will succeed.
2) Sensor mock is implemented on arduino, you can find it's sketch in ArduinoSensorMock folder.
	Upload it to arduino, connect uart bluetooth to arduino, set MAC in python script and you are ready to go.
	Sketch was tested on HC-06 UART bluetooth module, but should work on any UART BT module. Just set correct baudrate in the sketch.
