BT example UART setup instruction:

0) Install raspbian wheezy on you raspberry, just follow instructions on raspbian official site.
1) Call SetupSerialBaudRate.py with need baudrate as argument - it will set up uart.
2) Reboot RPI
3) Install prerequisites:
	a. sudo apt-get install python-pip
	b. sudo pip install pySerial
4) Disable Raspberry: sudo shutdown -h now, unplug micro-usb after 10-15 seconds
5) Do the wiring. Raspberry PI pinout depends on Raspberry version. You need to find RX and TX lines on your.
	a. Connect TX on bluetooth module to RX on raspberry
	b. Connect RX on bluetooth module to TX on raspberry
	c. Connect Ground on bluetooth module to Ground on RPI
	d. Checkout what voltage your BT module uses. RPI has 5V or 3.3V. 
		HC-06 module uses 3.3V, so if you have HC-06 BT module connect it's VCC to 3.3V on RPI.
	e. Power up raspberry.
6) Pair your device (cellphone, sensor or etc) with bluetooth module.
7) To start reading UART and sending data to gateway: python BluetoothUARTExample.py on your Raspberry

Notes:

1)	To check UART and wiring without bluetooth you can build test device using arduino and RPI. 
	You can find instructions in UartSetup.pdf (same folder)
2) Clearly this instruction should work for any bluetooth module that supports UART. 
	User just need to know uart baudrate and set it via script.
